Hi, I’m Sharun Satheesh 👋  

Data Analyst | MIS Analyst  
I turn raw data into clear, decision-ready insights.

🔹 Strong in SQL, Excel, Python, Power BI, Tableau  
🔹 Experience with end-to-end analysis: cleaning → EDA → dashboards → insights  
🔹 Projects across sales, business performance, defense & public datasets  

Currently focused on:
• Advanced SQL & query optimization  
• Business storytelling with dashboards  
• Interview preparation & real-world case studies  

I believe good analysis isn’t about numbers — it’s about clarity and impact.
