Hi, I’m Sharun Satheesh 👋  

I’m a Data Analyst with hands-on experience in SQL, Power BI, Excel, and Python, focused on turning raw data into meaningful business insights. I enjoy working with real-world datasets, cleaning messy data, performing exploratory analysis, and building dashboards that support decision-making.

I’ve worked on end-to-end analytics projects involving e-commerce, finance, global impact analysis, and operational datasets. My projects cover the full data lifecycle — data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

🔹 What I work with:
- SQL (Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions)
- Power BI (DAX, Power Query)
- Excel (Advanced formulas, Pivot Tables, Automation)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Tableau for interactive dashboards

🔹 What I’m currently focused on:
- Building real-world SQL + Power BI portfolio projects
- Improving data storytelling and business insight communication
- Preparing for Data Analyst roles and interviews

I believe good analysis is not just about numbers, but about telling clear, useful stories with data.
